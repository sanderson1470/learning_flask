Learning to use Flask and pair programming in BAIS:3300

Scott Anderson and Jack Coyne worked on this project together. This project consists of a web form. Inside the web form there is a home section that has a picture with both of us working together. There is also an about section that shows a little bit about us. 

Below this is the survey form where we identify the age, gender, country, highest degree, coding experience, current title, and the company size of the person taking the survey. We used flask in this assignment to run the application.
